# Balatro TO-DO
This project is a gamified to-do list based on the indie poker roguelite, Balatro. 
Tasks on the to-do list are organized into escalating "stakes" that represent task difficulty. 
Features:
* Backgrounds, music, sfx, pixel art from Balatro
* Tasks can be added, removed, copied or edited as the user pleases
* 3 screens: stake selection, to-do list and win screen
* Sector-based stake progress indicators
* Alternate stake art featuring popular characters and iconography
Tech stack:
1. Flutter: for development in dart
2. Android studio: for testing on Windows via android SDK and emulator
3. Gradle: For building application files for native testing on android
